# Basic_Searching-Sorting_Python

# Linear Search

In the beginning We have created the (1)Main Function (LinearSearch) which is heart of our program out Function Takes three Arguments 
1)arr(array of items through which we have to search)
2)n(length of the array)
3)x(number we have to Search)
The Function Runs the loop from dis import Instruction from multiprocessing.dummy import JoinableQueue
from 0(by default) to n(length of the array)
inside the loop we check the important condition arr[i]==x:
if during the loop running we find this condition true the function return
the number (i)
if not then our loop gets tired and gives up and says ok dude my job is done
now next Instruction please do your Job 
our next Instruction is return -1 which gets executed and we get out of the function
